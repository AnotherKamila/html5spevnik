    Hello,<br />
    I am that thing's project page.
</p>
<p class="intro">
    That thing is <span class="hl">a neat, touch-friendly, and human-friendly songbook/sheet music organizer</span> written as an <span class="hl">HTML5 offline app</span>.

<h1>The Plan</h1>

<p>It should have an almost paper-like feeling, at least in being minimal - no
distractions.</p>

<p>It should be easy to use for me and for my mother.</p>

<p>It should work offline.</p>

<p>It should work across all devices with modern browsers.</p>

<p>It is <em>not</em> planned to be in a working state anytime soon.</p>

<section>
<h1>Extensible!</h1>

<p>Even supposedly core parts (like displaying text/sheet music/guitar tabs) will actually be a form of plugins. Therefore, it might be possible to use it for more purposes than just keeping my sheet music tidy.</p>

<h1>Why all this</h1>

<p>The main reason why I am doing this is that I want to (1) try to write a
semi-serious web app, (2) learn about all the new html5 awesomeness and (3) get
the impression that I know Javascript.</p>

<p>I cannot avoid mentioning my long-term frustration about never having coded
anything interesting. I do a lot of algorithm design competitions, which is
cool, but that does not really give me the experience needed in The Real World.
I work for a web design company, but that's just struggling with CSS/swearing
about JQuery Mobile most of the time, and that is not even a bit cool. So this
is my first attempt at actually doing some coding that I might (possibly,
hopefully) end up maintaining and not hating at the same time.</p>
